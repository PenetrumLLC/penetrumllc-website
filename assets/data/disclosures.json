Valuation provided is historical and does not reflect present or future market value.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mb-6\">No consideration, compensation, or settlement has been received in connection with this abandonment. Penetrum LLC fully waives any and all rights to dividends, voting rights, governance participation, or corporate access related to these shares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"mb-6\">This public statement is issued in good faith and is retained as an official record for legal, accounting, and transparency purposes. This abandonment is undertaken without prejudice to any claims or defenses Penetrum LLC may retain regarding prior conduct by Internet 2.0 Pty Ltd unrelated to share ownership.</p>\n\n<div class=\"mt-10\">\n  <p class=\"font-semibold\">â€”</p>\n  <p class=\"font-semibold\">Penetrum LLC</p>\n  <p class=\"text-sm italic\">Dated: July 7th, 2025</p>\n</div>\n"
